Gear Tracker is an inventory system for wilderness travel and backpacking gear. (It probably works for other stuff, too.)


Features:
    - Metric and Imperial Weights
        Weights are always input in grams, but can be displayed in either metric (grams, kilograms) or imperial (ounces, pounds) units.

    - Public/Private Gear Lists
        A gear list can be marked either public or private.

        If a gear list is private, it will only be viewable to logged in users who have permissions to create a gear list. The intent behind allowing private lists is that you can create your gear list before you leave on a trip, but not make the gear list public until after you have returned. Thus, your trip is not public knowledge until you make it back.

    - Archivable Items
        Items can be archived.

        When an item is archived, it will not be displayed in any list of items (such as the All Gear list, or list of items by category/type/tag). The item's page will continue to exist, so that any hard-coded links (from your site or others) will not be broken.

        Archived items will continue to appear in any gear lists they might belong to. This is to retain the historical accuracy of the gear lists, and to avoid screwing with weights. The archived item's name will not be a link to the item's page, and the table row of the archived item will have a unique class applied to it so that the user may style it differently than non-archived items.

        The idea behind archivable items is that if you no longer possess an item, you may not want it to appear in your list of items. But you may want to retain the item's entry so that you can reference its weight in the future, and you don't want to delete the item outright for fear of thus invalidating old gear lists which that item may appear in.

Requirements:
